### Hi there 👋

✨ I'm a recent graduate from the Master of Information and Data Science program @ UC Berkeley, passionate about using data to create, communicate, & educate. I always try to apply my love for narrative to my work, which is why I believe that it's important to use the storytelling power of data in positively impactful and responsible ways. ✨
